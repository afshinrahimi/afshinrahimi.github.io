      Abstract We propose a label propagation approach to geolocation prediction based on 
	Modified Absorption, with two enhancements:(1) the removal of" celebrity" nodes to increase 
	location homophily and boost tractability; and (2) he incorporation of text-based geolocation 
	priors for test users. Experiments over three Twitter benchmark datasets achieve state-of-the-
	art results, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhancements.
